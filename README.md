# GoMod

GoMod is a moderator bot that's aiming to make moderation easy for everyone. ![Discord Bots](https://top.gg/api/widget/servers/940038014153949254.svg)

## What is this project?

This is supposedly an all-in-one moderator bot I built for Discord.

## What makes it stand out from other competitors?

GoMod may be still in development but I am planning to add features from seperate bots, and combining them into one bot. This can be for example: Autoroles, Reaction roles, verification systems, ticket system, and so much more.

## Do you have a website?

No, for now.

## Can I run your bot for myself?

I don't really allow those, but you can git clone it and run it on your own server. Make sure your server is Ubuntu, otherwise the command "ping" won't work (Ubuntu is needed to show system uptime).
