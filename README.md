# GoMod

GoMod is a moderator bot that's aiming to make moderation easy for everyone.

## What is this project?

This is a hobby project of mine. This is just a moderator bot I built for Discord for fun.

# What makes it stand out fromm other competitors?

GoMod may be still in development but I am planning to add features from seperate bots, and combining them into one bot. This can be for example: Autoroles, Reaction roles, verification systems, ticket system, and so much more.

## Do you have a website?

No, for now. GoMod will be a bot that uses the Discord Client to manage the bot, instead of using a website, like other bots.

## Can I run it for myself?

I don't really allow those, but you can git clone it and run it on your own server.
